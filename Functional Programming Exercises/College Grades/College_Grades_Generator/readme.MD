# School Grade Generator using HTML, JavaScript and CSS 


**Here, I want to explain the project scope and why I choose this specific structure using JavaScript.**

## HTML


## CSS

I use a basic CSS style only to give the user a better experience with interface. Also, when we refresh the page, all the information in the school grades are erased, this is made with CSS, using the "refresh file" incorporated with Javascript and and HTML.

1) ** This is the base CSS used in the page, just to make things look prettier:** https://github.com/arielabade/Web-Development/blob/main/College%20Grades/College_Grades_Generator/index.css

2) **This is the base CSS used only when the page is refreshed: ** https://github.com/arielabade/Web-Development/blob/main/College%20Grades/College_Grades_Generator/index.css
3) 

## JavaScript


## Why functional programming?
